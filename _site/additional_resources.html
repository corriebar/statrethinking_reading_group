<h2>Difference between frequentist and Bayesian approaches</h2>
<p>When learning about Bayesian statistics, it is common to hear a lot about how it is “better” than frequentist (or classic) statistics. However, it is not always clear what <strong>frequentist</strong> means. It is always good to remember that they provide different tools to analyze random events. Bayesian statistics does not make the frequentist toolbox irrelevant or invalid.</p>
<p>The following resources will give you an overview of the differences between both paradigms.</p>

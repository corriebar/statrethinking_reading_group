# Difference between frequentist and Bayesian approaches

When learning about Bayesian statistics, it is common to hear a lot about how it is "better" than frequentist (or classic) statistics. However, it is not always clear what **frequentist** means. It is always good to remember that they provide different tools to analyze random events. Bayesian statistics does not make the frequentist toolbox irrelevant or invalid.

The following resources will give you an overview of the differences between both paradigms.
